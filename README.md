# Identifying-Gentrification-Factors

Neighborhoods in big cities are in a constant state of change due to the movement of people and capital. This trend affects certain demographic groups that are forced to leave due to rising housing prices, increasing cost of living and cultural segregation. The goal is to consolidate data to identify factors of gentrification and create indices to detect early signs so that city planners and public officials can take necessary measures and mitigate the effects.

1. Scraping data from American Community Survey, Building Permits and Zillow to Collect data on demographic indicators, transportation accessibility and use, and housing market.

2. Clean the data from all the 3 sources using SAS. Selecting relevant variables for gentrification purposes and available selected features at block group level comes to 900.

3. Extract, Transform and Load the data into Postgrs SQL database located on GCP cloud. Create an ER data model and store the data using automated Python Scripts and SQL scripts.

4. Create a datawarehouse dimensional model for analysis.

5. Deployed Tableau server on top of GCP for reporting purpose, fiting statistical models and producing actionable insights through data visualization tools

6. Summarized the areas at a high risk of gentrification, so city planners can take necessary measures to mitigate gentrification effects.
